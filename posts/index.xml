      <description>yaml mani: kani  json { &amp;quot;mani&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;kani&amp;quot; }  The reason why there are still shops everywhere, I believe, is because people still want to see things, be inspired, and have human interaction. We want to be where the people are, where there is great energy.
synatx highlighting { &amp;#34;mani&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;kani&amp;#34; } synatx highlighting var s = &amp;#34;JavaScript syntax highlighting&amp;#34;; alert(s);  test var s = &amp;quot;JavaScript syntax highlighting&amp;quot;; alert(s);  list  te mani  blockquote  all is good</description>

      <description>Hi Dady,
I am the richest daughter in the world. I am not rich because I have lots of money but am richest because I have the BEST dad in the world. Whatever am today is because of you and mom. Your unconditional love and style is something I admire Dady. There is none like you. While writing this, I recollect a photo in which your holding me in your Kawasaki bike.</description>
